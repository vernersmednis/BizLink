# BizLink
This web application is developed using Visual Studio and C#. It connects to an MS SQL database to display, edit, and save records from the "Partners" table in the "Prakse" database.


# v1.0 implements the features
 - Display Records: View all entries from the "Partners" table.
 - Edit Records: Modify existing entries directly within the application.
 - Save Changes: Save edits back to the database.
 - Delete a record: Remove a record from the database.

 # Prereqs
  - The .NET SDK I had installed was (dotnet-sdk-8.0.402-win-x64.exe)[https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0] (Now seems to be replaced by Oct 8 version SDK 8.0.403).
  - If you have a need to repair the installation, when rerunning the installer pressing "repair" didn't help. I had to press "uninstall", then rerun again and press "install" again.

 # Installation Instructions
  - Open Visual Studio and press "Continue without code"
  - Go to File > Clone Repository 
  - In the “Clone a Repository” window, provide the URL of this GitHub repository (https://github.com/vernersmednis/BizLink.git) and choose a new local folder where you'd like to clone the project.
  - Click Clone. Visual Studio will pull the entire project from GitHub to that folder.
