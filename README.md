# BizLink
This web application is developed using Visual Studio and C#. It connects to an MS SQL database to display, edit, and save records from the "Partners" table in the "Prakse" database.


# v1.0 implements the features
 - Display Records: View all entries from the "Partners" table.
 - Edit Records: Modify existing entries directly within the application.
 - Save Changes: Save edits back to the database.
 - User-Friendly Interface: Optionally, both the list and editing features can be presented in a single view for enhanced usability.

 # Installation Instructions
